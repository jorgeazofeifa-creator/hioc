# HIOC Release Process

HIOC releases are built from the repository into a versioned package.

## Version Manifest

The authoritative version file is:

```text
VERSION.yaml
```

Required keys:

- `hioc_version`
- `core`
- `incident_engine`
- `correlation_engine`
- `forecast_engine`
- `inventory_engine`
- `dashboard`
- `schema`
- `mqtt_api`
- `installer`
- `build`

## Release Scripts

Release scripts live in `release/`:

- `build.sh`: creates `dist/build/HIOC-<version>`.
- `package.sh`: creates `dist/packages/HIOC-<version>.tar.gz`.
- `validate.sh`: validates release source structure, version manifest, Python syntax, and shell syntax when tools are available.
- `install.sh`: installs Pi4 and, when `/config` exists, Home Assistant files.
- `upgrade.sh`: backs up the current install, copies the new release, and reruns install.
- `rollback.sh`: restores the last release-upgrade backup or a provided backup path.

## Build

```bash
bash release/build.sh
bash release/package.sh
```

Artifact:

```text
dist/packages/HIOC-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Install

```bash
bash release/install.sh
```

The default target auto-detects the Pi4 collector when the Pi4 toolkit config exists and Home Assistant when `/config` exists.

Install only Pi4:

```bash
bash release/install.sh pi4
```

Install only Home Assistant files:

```bash
bash release/install.sh ha
```

## Upgrade

```bash
bash release/upgrade.sh
```

The upgrade script writes the latest backup path to:

```text
$HIOC_INSTALL_DIR/backups/last-upgrade-backup
```

## Rollback

Use the latest upgrade backup:

```bash
bash release/rollback.sh
```

Use a specific backup:

```bash
bash release/rollback.sh /home/jazofv1/hioc/backups/release-upgrade-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

## Runtime Version Reporting

The platform status publisher writes:

```text
state/platform/version.json
state/platform/status.json
```

It publishes retained MQTT topics:

```text
home/infrastructure/hioc/platform/version
home/infrastructure/hioc/platform/status
```
